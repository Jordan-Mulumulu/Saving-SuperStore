Saving Superstore: What to Cut and What to Keep

This dashboard takes a close look at Superstore’s return data and profit margins to figure out what’s helping the bottom line — and what’s holding it back. The goal? Help leadership make smarter decisions on what products and customer behaviors to cut or keep.

💡 What I Wanted to Find Out:
Which products are getting returned the most?

Who are the customers that keep sending stuff back?

How do return rates line up with profit margins across different product types?

📊 What’s in the Dashboard:
Product Return Rate: See which items are returned the most.

Customer Return Rate: Spot customers who return a lot.

Profit vs. Return Rate: Compare average return rates against profit to find high-risk, low-reward items.

Filters: Break things down by Region or Category to get a better look.

🛠️ Tools I Used:
Tableau Public

A LEFT JOIN on Orders and Returns (linked by Order ID)

A calculated field for return flag + return percentages

🔎 What I Found:
KI Adjustable-Height Table and Advantus Push Pins are some of the worst offenders on returns.

A few customers return more than 6% of what they buy — that's a red flag.

Phones and Chairs stand out with high return rates and low profit — time to rethink those.

Copiers, on the other hand, are solid: high profit and manageable returns.

📍 Why It Matters:
This dashboard gives a clear view of where Superstore might be losing money — and where it’s winning. It’s all about making smarter, data-backed decisions on what to cut, what to double down on, and how to run leaner and smarter.
